# Application-of-K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-Algorithm-for-Classification

The project applies the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify iris flower species using the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples evenly split among three classes: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The data was first explored and standardized to ensure balanced scaling, then split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. An initial KNN model with K=3 achieved perfect accuracy on the test data. Hyperparameter tuning via 10-fold cross-validation confirmed K=3 as the optimal choice, maximizing accuracy before it plateaued. The final model demonstrated reliable classification performance, confirming that KNN, combined with proper preprocessing and tuning, is an effective and straightforward method for classification tasks.
